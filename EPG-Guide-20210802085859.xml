<title lang="en" >Card Sharks</title>
<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

<desc lang="en">In this original version of iconic game show "Family Feud," actor Richard Dawson plays host to two teams, each comprised of five family members, who try to match the answers given to survey questions asked to groups of people (typically 100 people in the group). The family that wins the game by being the first to reach a certain point total, either 200 or 300 depending on the rules at the time, advances to the bonus round, called Fast Money, for a chance to win thousands of dollars by answering more survey questions.</desc>

<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

In a series of stories taking place in Toronto during the 1890s and early 1900s, several challenging murder cases arise. Murdoch uses up-and-coming forensics techniques and an unconventional approach, which often elicit skepticism from his fellow officers and his boss. Coroner Julia Ogden becomes Murdoch's number one ally, and they make a top-notch team, but he must struggle against tradition and prejudice to solve some of the city's most-gruesome murders.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Raised on an Australian cattle ranch with only horses for transportation, Chris Cox has had a lifetime of training around the animals. He now uses his vast experience to teach students how to get results when training their own horses. His common-sense, straightforward approach allows everyone from the average rider to the advanced equestrian to gain insight into equine behavior and reach the ultimate goal of a useful partnership between rider and mount. "Chris Cox Horsemanship" offers viewers much of the same information Cox provides when he travels across the world putting on demonstrations and clinics that help people understand and appreciate the horses in their lives.</desc>
